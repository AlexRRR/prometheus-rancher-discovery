# Prometheus-Rancher Service Discovery Bridge

This utility is a fork of https://github.com/DanielDent/prom-rancher-sd

prom-rancher-sd polls [Rancher's metadata service](http://docs.rancher.com/rancher/metadata-service/) and looks for containers with the `prometheus.port` label. 

A configuration file suitable for use by [Prometheus](http://prometheus.io/) is written to enable services to be monitored automatically. Prometheus will scrape `/metrics` via HTTP by connecting to the container's primary IP on the port specified by the `prometheus.port` label.`

## Prometheus configuration

Prometheus must be configure to read the generated files via `file_sd_configs` 

```
- job_name: 'rancher-discovery'
  file_sd_configs:
  - files:
    - /prom-rancher-sd-data/rancher.json
````

## Alert groups

The label `alert.group` might be added to the service, the value of is set as a prometheus label for the service, and is useful for routing alerts to specific groups using alertmanager.

##Â Testing

Test with the unittest discovery: 

```python -m unittest discovery```
